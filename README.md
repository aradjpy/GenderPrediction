# GenderPrediction
This is a simple gender prediction project where it helps predict gender and country of a name, in this project there was an interesting library used called FAKER in which it generates fake name and last names, and more importantly a dataset library called names_dataset, mostly the purpose of this project was working with pandas. 
While this is a kind of basic project, it—along with the ones that will follow—serves a larger purpose: rebuilding critical thinking skills rather than relying on having all the answers immediately available.

Some upcoming projects may involve Machine Learning or even Computer Vision, but the goal remains the same: completing everything without a single line of code written by AI. (Note: this text was grammatically refined by AI, so this is not meant as criticism or a promotion against using AI.)"
